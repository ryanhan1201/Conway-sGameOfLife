This is a program that runes on some very simple rules.
There is a certain grid of defined NxM size, where each cell within the grid is in one of two states: Dead or Alive.
Any cells that are alive that have fewer than 2 alive neighbours will die.
Any cells that are alive with exactly 2 or 3 alive neighbours wil stay alive.
Any cells that are alive with more than 3 alive neighbours will die.
Any dead cell with exactly three neighbours that are alive will become alive.

These rules are to mimic the affects either over or under population, thus being called "The Game of Life"
